# rva-screening

### What

A repository of early-stage design ideas for an application that would allow safety net health clinics in Richmond, VA to share income verification screening.

### Status

This project is in an early design stage. This repository contains no code. Instead, it only contains issues that are used to discuss potential features in the application, as well as links to documentation of the design process.

### Why

Assumptions that led to this app idea:

* Financial eligibilty screening is done redundantly for a given patient who applies to multiple safety net services.
* Financial eligibility screening is a significant source of delay between the time a patient is referred to a safety net health service and the time of their first treatment.
* Creating a more standardized process for financial elgibility will help clients and case managers to more easily discover services that a client would be eligible for.
* Reducing the time spent on financial eligibility screening would be helpful to clients as well as safety-net service providers.
